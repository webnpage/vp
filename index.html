      <h1>Iron Man</h1>
      <p>
        Directed by Jon Favreau, "Iron Man" is the film that kicked off the
        Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Released in 2008, the movie stars
        Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, a brilliant and wealthy industrialist
        who finds himself at the center of a life-altering experience. The story
        begins with Tony Stark, a genius inventor, and CEO of Stark Industries,
        being captured by terrorists while demonstrating his company's latest
        weapon in Afghanistan. Forced to build a weapon of mass destruction,
        Stark instead creates a powerful suit of armor to escape. This event
        marks a turning point for Stark, leading him to reevaluate his life and
        the impact of his company's weapons on the world.
